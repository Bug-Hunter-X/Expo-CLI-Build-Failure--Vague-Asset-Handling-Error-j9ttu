This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using Expo CLI for building a React Native application. The build process fails with an unclear error message relating to asset handling. The bug report includes the problematic code and a solution to resolve the build issue.  The solution involves thoroughly checking all assets used in the application, paying close attention to file naming and paths, to ensure they comply with Expo's asset handling requirements.
