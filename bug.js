While using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error during the build process.  The error message was vague, mentioning a problem with asset handling but not specifying the problematic asset. The build process would simply stop without providing detailed diagnostics or identifying the problematic asset. This made debugging very difficult as there was no way to pinpoint the source of the error.
